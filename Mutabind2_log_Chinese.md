# 近期Server改动

## Anya's suggestions

1. There is no link to homologous binding sites from the results page although we talk about it in the paper;

>    *单突变的结果页面有homologous binding sites*
>    ![alt img1](https://github.com/luyu103713/mutabind2_document/raw/master/imgs/19.1.png)
>    *而多突变无法给出，所以没有*
>    ![alt img1](https://github.com/luyu103713/mutabind2_document/raw/master/imgs/19.2.png)

2.	The download file has energy terms which are not described anywhere including “Model_bias” – what is it?

>    *在readme文件里面中增加了一句*
>    *Model_bias is the average of the DDGexp in S4191/S1707.*
>    *预测值=Model_bias(训练集的实验值的平均值)+各个feature贡献值，详细的有关random forest的解释*
>    *<http://engineering.pivotal.io/post/interpreting-decision-trees-and-random-forests/>*

3.	“More details can be found in our paper.” – it should be changed into “more details can be found in the paper …and give a link to the paper);

>    *更改了首页的Reference和增加了"More details can be found in our paper"后面我们文献的pubmed链接*
